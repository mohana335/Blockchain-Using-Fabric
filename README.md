This is a blockchain based smart contracts which will resolve many security vulnerabilities associated with remote patient monitoring. 
Also, this smart contract system will  support real-time patient monitoring and maintain a secure record for patients through blockchain. 
Basically, it is a part of our research work named "A Secure Patient Monitoring System Based on Blockchain Smart-Contracts and IoT for Healthcare".

# Implementation Environment

For Hyperledger Fabric, the operating system we were using was Ubuntu (version
20.04.1 LTS). Fabric required git 2.9+, npm v5.x, Docker Engine 17.03+, and Docker Compose 1.8+ before it could be installed. Fabric was finally installed using the official
github repository (HyperLedger.github.io). JavaScript language and VScode is used for the coding part and Couch DB is used as a database.

A network called "test-network" is set up using scripts from the fabric-samples repository by following this link- https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples

To deploy and test the Fabric chaincodes and applications, the steps are followed using this link- https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html
